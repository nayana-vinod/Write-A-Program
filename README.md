# Write-A-Program
A collection of different programs in different languages.

Your Program can be anything from a simple Hello World program to a complex Data Structure Program.

## For Contributing
* Select the language of your program and add your code in that particular folder
* If the language you are looking for is not already available, you are free to create a folder with that language name and add your files to that.

* Different types of folders might be available for a same type of programs, if yeah add yours to those. 
* If no and you feel like a group folder is needed then add one, no worries:)

For example:
      You wrote a pattern program in c++. 
       If no c++ folder, add a c++ folder, inside it add a pattern folder, and add your program.
       If there is c++ folder,but no pattern folder inside - add a pattern folder and add your program
       If there is a c++ folder and a pattern folder inside already add yours in to that.
